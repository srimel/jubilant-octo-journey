                    My name is Stuart Rimel and I'm currently working on my
                    master's degree in computer science at Portland State
                    University. I am focusing on the software engineering track
                    but will also take some classes from the programming
                    langugages and AI/ML tracks. My previous background has been
                    working in cytogenetic laboratories performing genetic
                    testing for cancer patients for about 8 years. Currently,
                    I'm working as a technical course support specialist (TCSS)
                    for the intro to computer science sequence at PSU, which has
                    involved facilitating lab sections, tutoring, and grading
                    student programs. I'm currently looking forward to future
                    internships and learning opportunities to help prepare me
                    for a successful career pivot into the tech industry!
